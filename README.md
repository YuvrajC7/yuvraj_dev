## UpRock Companion Clone

This is my submission for the frontend challenge. I built a replica of the UpRock Companion landing page, focusing on the layout, dark mode aesthetic, and animations.

**Live Site:** [https://yuvraj-dev.vercel.app](https://yuvraj-dev.vercel.app)

## Tech Stack
* Next.js for the framework
* Framer Motion for the reveal animations and interactions

## Workflow
I broke the page down into modular components (Navbar, Hero). I set up the global CSS to go with the dark background.
For the animations, I used Framer Motion to create the stagger effects on the text and the floating elements on the right side. I also made sure the navbar works on mobile devices with a custom hamburger menu.

## How to Run It

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/yuvraj-dev.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/yuvraj-dev.git)
    cd uprock-clone
    ```

2.  Install packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Start the dev server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
